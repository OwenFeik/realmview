* Projects
    * /project/PROJECT_KEY should show a page with the scenes in that project
        and project metadata
    * /project should show the same page but empty, with prompt to save the
        project and create a scene
* Game
    * Show current game key, provide link to join game
    * Navigating to scene.html?game=GAME_KEY should connect to that game
